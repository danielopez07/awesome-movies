Instructions:

- Install and activate the theme

- Execute the hook themoviedb_cron to get the site content from the themoviedb.org API

- In order to execute that hook I used the plugin WP Control (https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crontrol/)

- From the WordPress customizer (enter the admin area, then Appearance -> Customize):
go to Homepage Settings, add a New Page, select it as Homepage, and select "Your homepage displays" -> "A static page"
